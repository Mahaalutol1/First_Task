                I am thrilled to introduce myself to you.
                 I am Maha, a 21-year-old computer engineering student with a deep passion for languages. 
                 Although my academic background is in computer engineering .
                 I have dedicated a significant part of my educational journey to the study and exploration of both English and Arabic languages.
                As a native Arabic speaker, I am excited to embark on this learning journey with you and share 
                my knowledge and enthusiasm for both English and Arabic in a friendly and professional manner.
